              <p>My Bandcamp page was initially made ages ago and was used mainly to upload random tracks I made in Garageband. The first "Album" was uploaded on October 13th 2021, however, there was another collection of tracks uploaded before then. Those have since been deleted.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Most of the Albums and EPs uploaded there (Up until late 2024) were not mixed well and mainly just showed my production and songwriting skills. After the release of <a href="https://kylomusic.bandcamp.com/album/a-new-beginning-super-deluxe-edition">A New Beginning</a>, I started studying Audio Production at SAE, and used some of the skills I learnt there to make new tracks (May or may nt be released as of writing this).</p>
              <br>
              <p>The game itself is solid and, with a somewhat replayable experience designed with speedrunners in mind. It also includes customization which let players change both the ball and the background skybox. While the feature is poorly implemented, figuring out how to add it taught me how to properly implement customization in future projects.</p>

              <p><a href="https://chopsdev.itch.io/stepping-stones">Stepping Stones</a> was a game I chose to create within unity as a way to pass time while I was undergoing chemotherapy. The develoment was challenging for me, taking roughly 5 to 6 months to complete. It allowed me to learn and understand how to make a game that feels enjoyable and responsive to play.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Though the game's art style is minimalist, I took heavy inspiration from the 2D platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/Downwell/">Downwell</a>, making all the sprites and animations myself while incorporating similar UI/UX designs elements.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The game itself doesn't have much for the player to do other than jumping left to right, but the game is responsive and snappy and has a basic replayability loop. With Players' high scores are saved based on tile height or speed, depending on the selected height. The game also has simple cosmetics that can be unlocked by collecting coins for each jump the player does.</p>

          <p>Flicker Out started while I was living in Canada for my gap year before going university. One thing that quickly stood out to me was that Canada had a more prominent smoking culture compared to NZ since tobacco and legalized weed were cheap and easily accessible no matter where you went.</p>
          <br>
          <p>At the time, I had switched from Unity to Godot and was struggling to come up with a solid game idea. Then one day, I accidentally ate a edible cookie, got stoned, and then spent way too long flicking a lighter I had stolen from a friend. At some point, my finger started getting sore, and I began missing flicks. And that's when it hit me - this could be a game.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Because the core gameplay was simple, I chose to test my writing skills to see where it would lead me. Since I couldn't think of a solid concept. I instead wanted to play around the idea of the game having a feel of complexity but once you look into the finer meaning it just shows that it really isn't that important.</p>

          <p>The weird thing about this art style isn't the art itself — it’s that I had to work with and against my GPU glitching out. The main issue when I could work with it was that the files would never look the same. The GPU was constantly changing the images. When I moved the screen or reopened it after a crash the design would take on a new shape or change the colours and where everything is placed. what do you think?</p>
